Ride Hailing Demand Forecasting and Linear Surge Cost Model

This is an anlysis I did for sample data in the ride-hailing marketplace.
The goal was to find ways to bridge supply and demand more efficiently using forecasting for expected demand.

The script includes:
Exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, feature design, 
Exponential moving average (EMA) and LSTM models for demand predicition, 
A dynamic surge cost model,
A/B testing description.

SampleData uploaded contains 80% of original data, so results may differ slightly from the results shown.
